This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CAT (Closed-loop Adversarial Training) is a research project for safe end-to-end autonomous driving using adversarial scenario generation. The system dynamically creates safety-critical traffic scenarios to train more robust driving policies using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
conda create -n cat python=3.9
conda activate cat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build and Compilation
```bash
# Compile Cython extensions for performance optimization
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### Main Execution Commands
```bash
# Run adversarial scenario generation and visualization
python cat_advgen.py

# Train CAT policy with adversarial scenarios
python cat_RLtrain.py --mode cat --seed 0

# Generate learning curve plots
./scripts/plot.sh
```

### Data Processing Commands
```bash
# Convert Waymo data to MetaDrive format
python scripts/convert_WOMD_to_MD.py

# Filter scenarios (9.1s, 1 ego + 1 opponent + n vehicles)
python scripts/select_cases.py

# Visualization and analysis
python scripts/plot.py
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Adversarial Generation** (`advgen/`):
   - `adv_generator.py`: Neural network-based adversarial scenario generator
   - `modeling/vectornet.py`: VectorNet architecture for trajectory prediction
   - `modeling/decoder.py`: Multi-modal trajectory decoders
   - `pretrained/densetnt.bin`: Pre-trained DenseTNT traffic behavior model

2. **Simulation Environment** (`metadrive/`):
   - Modified MetaDrive simulator with Waymo integration
   - `envs/real_data_envs/waymo_env.py`: Waymo dataset environment
   - `policy/replay_policy.py`: Policy implementations and replay functionality

3. **Reinforcement Learning** (`saferl_algo/`):
   - `TD3.py`: Twin Delayed DDPG implementation for safety-aware RL
   - Specialized for closed-loop adversarial training

### Data Flow
1. Waymo scenarios â†’ MetaDrive format conversion
2. Scenario filtering and preprocessing
3. Adversarial scenario generation using neural networks
4. Policy training with TD3 in adversarial environments
5. Safety evaluation (crash rates, route completion)

## Key Files and Entry Points

- **`cat_advgen.py`**: Main demonstration of adversarial scenario generation
- **`cat_RLtrain.py`**: CAT training pipeline with TD3
- **`advgen/adv_generator.py`**: Core adversarial generation logic
- **`setup.py`**: Cython compilation configuration
- **`raw_scenes_500/`**: Preprocessed Waymo scenarios (500 scenes)

## Dependencies and Requirements

### Critical Dependencies
- Python 3.9 (Cython compatibility)
- PyTorch (GPU support recommended)
- Gym 0.22.0 (specific version requirement)
- Panda3D (3D simulation rendering)
- Waymo Open Dataset tools

### Data Requirements
- DenseTNT pretrained model: `advgen/pretrained/densetnt.bin`
- Waymo WOMD v1.1 validation/testing_interactive data
- 500 preprocessed scenarios in `raw_scenes_500/`

## Performance Considerations

### Cython Optimization
- `advgen/utils_cython.pyx` contains performance-critical computations
- Must be compiled with `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` after changes
- Generated `.so` files are platform-specific

### GPU Acceleration
- CUDA support available for PyTorch operations
- Automatic CPU fallback implemented
- GPU recommended for training but not required for inference

## Development Notes

### Neural Network Architecture
- VectorNet: Graph-based trajectory prediction with spatial relations
- Multi-modal decoders for trajectory generation
- Pre-trained DenseTNT provides traffic behavior priors

### Simulation Features
- Real-time 3D rendering with top-down visualization
- Multi-agent traffic scenarios with physics simulation
- Comprehensive sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras)

### Safety Metrics
- Attack success rate measurement
- Crash detection and route completion tracking
- Adversarial effectiveness evaluation
